# It is a project for udacity Full Stack Developer Nanodegree.
## This project is about how to configure a linux web server. 
<p> I have learned so many things in project. It's a good idea to 
learn how system's works in the cloud. And how you can have a little 
piece of internet for yourself on the cloud. Like there someone in the 
clouds, who listenes to your instructions(It's not god, It's my server).</P


## This server is hosted on Amazon lightsail instance.
    Create a new GitHub repository and add a file named README.md.

  

## Information for reviewer
1. The Ip address of the website/server is 13.127.233.24 and port for ssh is 2200.
2. 13.127.233.24

## Softwares/packages that were needed to run for this project
<p> The number one thing, when we are setting a server, we need a http server. 
Which can listen to requests and respond(not like god, who just listens and never answers.
That's why I don't have a girlfriend. Pun intended). So for this we need Apache server not god.
The second thing we need is mod-wsgi client who sits on top of the apache(Apache told me, he does not like 
someone sitting on him. It pisses him off. Afterall who can tolerate a person, who is sitting on you all the time.)
wsgi just connects apache to python application. It was hard, it took some time to understand how it works. It took
some time to manage apache to let him wsgi sit on him.</p>
<p> I have also used Postgres. Because Postgres is cool. And I always like to be friends with cool people. and with 
cool softwares.</p>
